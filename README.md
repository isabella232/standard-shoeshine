## Usage

Find the ```style.css``` file for the Standard Child Theme Kit and locate the "Customizations" section. You can add your own styles under this section to override the styles that come with Standard.

If you happened to name Standard 3 theme directory anything else besides "standard" when you installed the theme, you will need to update the "Template" name and the ```@import``` path in the Standard Child Theme Kit's ```style.css``` in order for it to work correctly.
